# 1. Getting Started

Solr makes it easy for programmers to develop sophisticated, high-performance search applications with advanced features such as faceting (arranging search results in columns with numberical counts of key terms). Solr builds on another open source serach technology: Lucene, a Java library that provides indexing and search technology, as well as apellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities. Both Solr and Lucene are managed by the Apache Software Foundation ([www.apache.org](http://www.apache.org))

The Lucene search library currently ranks among the top 15 open source projects and is one the top 5 Apache projects, with installations at over 4,000 companies. Lucene/Solr downloads have grown neraly ten times over the past three years, with a curren run-rate of over 6,000 downloads a day. The Solr search server, which provides application builders a ready-to-use search platform on top of the Lucene search library, it the fastest growing Lucene sub-project. Apache Lucene/Solr offers an attractive alternative to the proprietary licensed search and discovery software vendors.
